<p>
</p><h5>The life and character of John the Baptist have always had a great
fascination.
 
<p>As the clasp between the Old Testament and the New--the close of the
one and the beginning of the other; as among the greatest of those born
of women; as the porter who opened the door to the True Shepherd; as
the fearless rebuker of royal and shameless sin--the Baptist must ever
compel the homage and admiration of mankind.</p>
 
<p>In many respects, such a life cannot be repeated.  But the spirit of
humility and courage; of devotion to God, and uncompromising loyalty to
truth, which was so conspicuous in him, may animate us.  We, also, may
be filled with the spirit and power of Elijah, as he was; and may
point, with lip and life, to the Saviour of the world, crying, "Behold the Lamb of God."</p>
<br>

</p></h5><h2 id="John in the Bible">John the Baptist in the Bible</h2>
 
John 1
 
<p>1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br> 
 
2 He was in the beginning with God.<br> 
 
3 All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.<br> 
 
4 In him was life,a and the life was the light of men.<br> 
 
5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.<br> 
 
<b>6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.<br> 
 
7 He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him.<br> 
 
8 He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.<br> 
 
9 The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.<br> 
 
10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him.</b><br></p> 
<hr>
<p>
11 He came to what was his own,but his own people did not receive him.<br> 
 
12 But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,<br> 
 
13 who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.<br> 
 
14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and 31truth.<br> 
 
15 (John bore witness about him, and cried out, "This was he of whom I said,`He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.`")<br> 
 
16 And from his fullness we have all received, 35grace upon grace.<br> 
 
17 For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.<br> 
 
18 No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father`s sidee, he has made him known.<br> 
 
19 And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"<br> 
 
20 He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ."<br></p>

21 And they asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not.""Are you the Prophet?" And he answered, "No."<br> 
 
22 So they said to him, "Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"<br> 
 
23 He said, "I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, `Make straightf the way of the Lord,` as the prophet Isaiah said."<br> 
 
24 (Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.)<br> 
 
26 John answered them, "I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know,<br> 
 
27 even he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie."<br> 
 
28 These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.<br> 
 
29 The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, <a href="https://saintmariamogt.freevar.com/html1" title="Saint Mariam"><b>"Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!"</b></a><br> 
 
30 This is he of whom I said,`After me comes a man who ranks before me, because he was before me.
<hr>
<p> 
 
31 I myself did not know him, but for this purpose I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel."<br> 
 
32 And John bore witness: "I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.<br> 
 
33 I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, `He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.<br> 
 
34 And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God."<br> 
 
35 The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples,<br> 
 
36 and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"<br> 
 
37 The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.<br> 
 
38 Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, "What are you seeking?" And they said to him, "Rabbi" (which means Teacher), "where are you staying?" 
 
39 He said to them, "Come and you will see." So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour of the day.<br> 
 
40 One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesush was Andrew, Simon Peter`s brother.<br></p> 
<hr>
<p>
 
41 He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (which means Christ).<br> 
 
42 He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "So you are Simon the son of John? You shall be called Cephas" (which means Peteri).<br> 
 
43 The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, "Follow me."<br> 
 
44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.<br> 
 
45 Philip found Nathanael and said to him, "We have found him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."<br> 
 
46 Nathanael said to him, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" Philip said to him, "Come and see."<br> 
 
47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!"<br> 
 
48 Nathanael said to him, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."<br>

49 Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!"<br> 
 
50 Jesus answered him, "Because I said to you, `I saw you under the fig tree,` do you believe? You will see greater things than these."
<br>
  
 
51 And he said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."<br>

</p><h2 id="Repentance">Repentance</h2>
It cannot be too strongly emphasized that repentance is an act of the _will_.  In its beginning there may be no sense of gladness or reconciliation with God: but just the consciousness that certain ways of life are wrong, mistaken, hurtful, and grieving to God; and the desire, which becomes the determination, to turn from them, to seek Him who formed the mountains and created the wind, that maketh the morning darkness and treadeth upon the high places of the earth.Repentance may be accounted as the other side of faith.  They are the two sides of the same coin: the two aspects of the same act.  If the act of the soul which brings it into right relation with God is described as a turning round, to go in the reverse direction to that in which it had been travelling, then _repentance_ stands for its desire and choice to turn from sin, and _faith_ for its desire and choice to turn to God.  We must be willing to turn from sin and our own righteousness--that is _repentance_; we must be willing to be saved by God, in his own way, and must come to Him for that purpose--that is_faith_.We need to turn from our own righteousnesses as well as from our sins.Augustine spoke of his efforts after righteousness as splendid sins;and Paul distinctly disavows all those attempts to stand right with God which he made before he saw the face of the risen Christ looking out from heaven upon his conscience-stricken spirit.  You must turn away from your own efforts to save yourself.  These are, in the words of the prophet, but "filthy rags."  Nothing, apart from the Saviour and his work, can avail the soul, which must meet the scrutiny of eternal justice and purity.Repentance is produced sometimes and specially by the presentation of the claims of Christ.  We suddenly awake to realize what He is, how He loves, how much we are missing, the gross ingratitude with which we respond to his agony and bloody sweat, his cross and suffering, the beauty of his character, the strength of his claims.

<h2 id="Point">Point</h2>
 The meaning of the saying "the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie." when John was asked "who he is?",is found in the story of Ruth in the Old Testaments witch tells like this...when Boaz wanted to do favor for Nahomi,he called on the man who is in charge of her husband's land and told him to redeem it,the man answered "i will" but when Boaz bring up the conditions witch is that he also have to acquire Ruth the widow,daughter of Nahomi the redeemer refused saying that he can not redeem it for himself lest he impair his own inerhitance and passed the redemption for Boaz...
 Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging: to confirm a transaction, the one drew off his sandal and gave it to the other, and this was the manner of attesting in Israel:that one is not capable of taking responsibility.So when John The Baptist talk about"not taking of the shoes of The LORD but even not capable of untie it"he is emphasizing that The LORD is the real redeemer of the church.Here we can see how much the Bible is coherent and John's understanding of the Bible,we can also say that he made the first typology practical.
