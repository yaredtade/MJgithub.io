The sun became dark when it saw its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus">Creator crucified by His own will</a>, and that which should have been visible covered itself over. And the period of darkness lasted from the sixth to the ninth hour, and in that time our Lord bowed His head by His own free will, and delivered up His understanding and rational soul which He had received from our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary mother of Jesus"> Lady, the Virgin Mary</a>, and that soul was separated from its body. And it went into Sheol without separation from the Godhead, even as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Peter">Saint Peter</a> the apostle saith, He was dead in the body and alive in the spirit. And at that same time His body was hung upon the wood of the Cross, without separation from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity">Godhead</a>. Similarly His soul descended into Sheol, like a released prisoner, and it had one nature and was without separation from the Godhead. And He was exalted high above the heavens, sitting with the Father and the Holy Spirit. Salutation to Thy Passion, O God the King. Salutation to Thy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion of Jesus">Crucifixion on the Cross</a>. Salutation to the going forth of Thy Soul from Thy Body.
